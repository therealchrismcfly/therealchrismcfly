# About Me 

Hi, my name is Chris and I'm from Cologne, Germany. I worked about 10 years in Online Marketing (agencies, startups and a software company). Because I want to make a career change, I just started a **Web Development Bootcamp** at neuefische. I'm excited to learn great new stuff and to also share my knowledge.
